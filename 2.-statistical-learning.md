# 2. Statistical Learning

### 2.1 What is Statistical Learning

#### Prediction

The relationship between the outputs/dependent variables  $$Y$$ and predictors/features/independent variables $$X$$ :

$$
Y = f(X) + \epsilon
$$

The prediction $$\hat{Y} $$ :

$$
\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)
$$

> 1. What does the accuracy of the prediction depends on?

#### Inferences

The importance of these questions depends on the specific problems and goals.

1. _Which predictors are associated with the response?_

   There is always only a few important predictors.

2. _What is the relationship between the response and each predictor?_

   Positive, negative, dependence on the other predictors.

3. _Can the relationship between_ $$Y$$_and each predictor be adequately summarized using a linear equation, or is the relationship more complicated?_

   Linearity is usually a favored assumption but may not be accurate. 

> 1. The **reducible error** and the **irreducible error**
>    * the reducible error: $$\hat{f}$$ can be potentially improved to estimate $$f$$
>    * the irreducible error: $$\epsilon $$, which cannot be predicted using $$X$$
